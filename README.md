# Code-of-CEW
 We proposed a commutative encryption and watermarking algorithm based on compound chaotic systems and zero-watermarking for vector map.
 All the codes in this experiment are written in Python 3.x and implemented on Windows 10 64-bit PC. The vector map data used in the experimen are available from OpenStreetMap (https://download.geofabrik.de).
 The sample code is for polyline data. If you need to operate on polygon data, you only need to replace part of the code for reading and writing vector map data with Read_Write.py.
 The script we provide only needs to modify the absolute storage path of the data to run.
